# web_speech_guessing_game_pt-br
A web number guessing game that uses voice recognition as input

This project was made while following a class on how to use the Web Speech API, so it can be seen just a fun practice project :)  
And, as you might have guessed by the title, this project was made in brazilian portuguese, I made this because I plan on playing this game with other portuguese speaking people, so it just made more sense that way.
